## What is "masquerade proxy"?

A masquerade proxy is a concept designed to disguise your requests as something "boring" by using techniques like steganography. This makes it harder for "spies"â€”such as ISPs, government entities, sniffers, or network managersâ€”to identify or monitor your traffic.

Additionally, a key purpose of a masquerade proxy is to conceal its very nature as a proxy. By appearing as legitimate, non-proxy traffic, it reduces the likelihood of being detected or blocked by network administrators or automated filters.
