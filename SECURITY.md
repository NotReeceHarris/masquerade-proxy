# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

I strongly recommend using the most recent version of this project. Older versions may contain vulnerabilities, bugs, or exploits that have been resolved in later releases.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe a vulnerability compromises user security or privacy, **please contact me directly before creating an issue** to ensure it is addressed promptly and securely. You can reach me via:

- **Email:** [me@reeceharris.net](mailto:me@reeceharris.net)  
- **Twitter DM:** [@N0tReeceHarris](https://x.com/N0tReeceHarris)

For vulnerabilities that do not significantly affect users or have already been patched, feel free to create an issue directly. Even if a vulnerability has been resolved, reporting it helps improve overall transparency and security.
